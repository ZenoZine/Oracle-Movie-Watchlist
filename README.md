# Movie Watchlist - Oracle Apex Application

## Overview

The **Movie Watchlist** is an Oracle Apex application designed to help users manage and organize movies they wish to watch. Leveraging the TMDb API, the application provides a seamless experience for discovering and tracking movies. 

This project was developed as a learning exercise to better understand Oracle Apex, the platform used by my university for hosting its systems. It also serves as a foundation for my work with the local honors college to revitalize their websites using Oracle Apex.
